  <p>Yup, I'm doing this. You can <a href="https://github.com/steveklabnik/aoc2017">check out the source on GitHub</a>, or try them out in your browser:</p>

  </ol>
  <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
  <p>I haven't done any cross-browser testing, so if you're not running Firefox
  Nightly (my everyday browser), I can't guarantee that everything works. Wasm is
  supported in all evergreen browsers, but I think some of the string handling
  stuff I am doing needs a polyfill on some platforms that I didn't include.
  Sorry about that!</p>
